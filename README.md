## Hey there, I'm Benny! 👋

### Chartered Marketer turned open-source tinkerer.

I'm a technical marketer based in Melbourne, Australia (by way of Winnipeg, Canada) who likes building tools that make marketers' and developers' lives a little easier.

Most of my work lives under Flash Brew Digital, where I build things like form attribution helpers, Webflow extension scaffolding, and an Agent Skills validator. I care about clean developer experiences and well-documented projects.

When I'm not writing code or prompting AI agents: I'm usually studying comms at Deakin University, volunteering at local events, or drinking my [10th iced latte of the day](https://buymeacoffee.com/bensabic).

If you're bored, try the typing game or laugh at the jokes on my [terminal portfolio](https://bensabic.dev/).
